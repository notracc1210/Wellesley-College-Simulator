LOCATION:LULU
CONTEXT:It is peak lunch hour at Lulu. The air is thick with steam, the clatter of trays, and overlapping conversations in three different languages. You stand in front of the food stations, shifting your weight from foot to foot, feeling like everyone else already knows exactly what they’re doing here except you.

OPTION:Get the classic combo of pizza and fries.|You pile a slice and a mountain of fries onto your plate, convincing yourself that today you’ve earned some comfort. The first bites are amazing, but halfway through you feel your body slow down, like someone quietly turned down your internal brightness.|+3,-1,+1,0.00

OPTION:Skip “real food” and go straight for dessert.|You load up a plate with cake and cookies, pretending this is a hilarious, empowering decision. For a glorious ten minutes you’re buzzing with sugar and joy—until your brain fogs over and concentration becomes a distant dream.|+4,-2,+1,0.00
OPTION:Decide it’s all too much and walk out without eating.|You tell yourself you’ll “just grab something later,” but later never really comes. Your stomach complains through your next class, and every little stress feels twice as loud.|-3,-2,0,0.00

CONTEXT:The stir-fry station is a chaotic theater of sizzling pans, bursts of flame, and impatient students half-watching their phones, half-watching the food. You’re close enough to feel the heat, but the line barely moves, and you can feel your patience draining with every passing minute.

OPTION:Commit to waiting in the stir-fry line.|You decide that flavor and warmth are worth the time tax, and stick it out while others give up. When your bowl finally lands in your hands, the first bite feels like a tiny victory you secretly needed today.|+3,+1,+1,0.00

OPTION:Buy two slices and call it “self-care.”|You laugh with the cashier and insist that this is absolutely, definitely necessary. The first slice tastes like freedom; the second tastes like you’re trying to fill a hole that sugar can’t actually fix.|+5,-3,+1,0.00
OPTION:Walk away on purpose, refusing to buy it.|You stand there for a few seconds longer, then turn and leave, surprising yourself with your own discipline. As you head back to your table empty-handed, there’s a subtle sense that maybe you’re capable of more control than you thought.|+2,+1,0,0.00
OPTION:Buy the dessert and immediately hand it to a friend.|Their face lights up with a kind of joy that feels contagious.

OPTION:Close your laptop and go to the meeting.|You show up, cheer, brainstorm, and leave feeling full of inside jokes and shared energy. Later that night, though, the sight of untouched readings brings a quiet dread that knocks politely but persistently on the back of your mind.

CONTEXT:Your group chat explodes with messages: someone suggests a late-night snack run from Lulu, and suddenly everyone is sending chaotic emojis and variations of “I’m in.” It’s already late, and you can feel fatigue gripping your shoulders, but the idea sounds dangerously fun.

OPTION:Reply “YES” with ten exclamation marks and go all in.|You meet under the flickering lights, order fries and something sugary, and talk about everything and nothing until the staff start stacking chairs.

LOCATION:CLUB
CONTEXT:You’re on the lawn near the lake during golden hour, surrounded by students sprawled with books and blankets. A friend suggests, “Let’s do a little ‘money and goals’ reflection session—no pressure, just journaling and talking.”

OPTION:Agree and write honestly about how you want your relationship with money to feel in five years.|What ends up on the page surprises you: less about being rich, more about feeling safe, generous, and not constantly scared. Saying some of it out loud to your friend feels quietly revolutionary.|+4,0,+3,+0.02
OPTION:Journal privately but keep most of the conversation surface level.|You gain some clarity for yourself and still enjoy the cozy atmosphere, even if you don’t share much.|+2,0,+1,+0.01
OPTION:Sit with them but doodle instead, refusing to think about money at all.|The evening is still pleasant, but your avoidance keeps acting like a quiet undertow beneath your life.|0,0,+1,-0.01
OPTION:Tell them this sounds “too intense” and go back to your room to watch videos instead.|You choose comfort over reflection, and the next time money stress spikes, you have one less tool to meet it with.|-1,0,0,-0.02

A NEW CONTEXT BEGINS

LOCATION:CLUB
CONTEXT:It’s a windy day on the lawn, and your carefully organized stack of financial aid documents flies out of your folder, scattering towards the lake like panicked birds. Nearby students look up as papers take flight.

OPTION:Laugh, call out “Paper chase!” and enlist people nearby to help you gather them.|Within minutes, half a dozen hands are snatching sheets from the grass. You end up breathless, grateful, and oddly touched by how quickly strangers moved to help.|+3,+1,+4,0.00
OPTION:Sprint after the papers alone, frantically stuffing them back in the folder.|You recover most of them, but your heart is pounding and your cheeks burn with embarrassment.|-1,+1,0,-0.01
OPTION:Let a few papers go and decide you’ll ask the office to reprint them later.|You avoid wading into thorny bushes or mud, but create more admin work for yourself and the staff.|-1,0,0,-0.02
OPTION:Freeze for a moment, too stunned to move, and only react when someone else starts grabbing them.|You feel weirdly disconnected from your own life, watching other people rescue your documents.|-2,0,-1,-0.01

A NEW CONTEXT BEGINS

LOCATION:CLUB
CONTEXT:There’s a small table inside Club labeled “Student Employment Fair – Informal Q&A.” Several supervisors are sitting there, each with a sign for different jobs: library, dining, tutoring, media, front desk, and more.

OPTION:Go down the line and ask each supervisor what a typical day in their job looks like.|You gather a mosaic of possibilities, from quiet desk shifts to chaotic rush hours, and start to see which ones match both your schedule and your temperament.|+3,0,+3,+0.03
OPTION:Talk only to the job you already think you want.|You get deeper details about one path and leave feeling clearer about that specific choice, even if you missed other options.|+2,0,+1,+0.02
OPTION:Hover awkwardly, pick up one pamphlet, and leave quickly.|You get a tiny bit of information but not enough to really make a confident choice.|-1,0,0,-0.01
OPTION:Decide you’re “too late in the year” to look for jobs and walk past.|Opportunities that are still open stay invisible to you, and your schedule remains emptier (and your bank account smaller) than it needed to be.|-2,0,0,-0.03

A NEW CONTEXT BEGINS

LOCATION:CLUB
CONTEXT:You’re sitting on the grass near Club, laptop open to your bank portal and student account, numbers glaring in the sun. Birds are chirping, someone is laughing by the water, and you’re trying not to cry over a spreadsheet.

OPTION:Take a deep breath and categorize your expenses for the month, no judgment, just data.|Seeing the numbers organized hurts, but it also transforms vague dread into something you can actually make decisions around.|+2,0,0,+0.03
OPTION:Call a trusted friend or family member and talk through the numbers with them.|Their perspective and reassurance keep you from spiraling alone, and together you brainstorm a few realistic adjustments.|+3,0,+3,+0.02
OPTION:Close all tabs the moment your chest tightens and pretend you never opened them.|The relief is immediate and short-lived; the same numbers will be waiting for you later, unchanged.|-2,0,0,-0.02
OPTION:Channel the anxiety into a flurry of unrealistic resolutions in a notes app, then never look at them again.|You get a brief buzz of “I’m fixing my life!” followed by the slow disappointment of not following through.|-1,0,0,-0.01

A NEW CONTEXT BEGINS

LOCATION:CLUB
CONTEXT:You’re leaving Club at dusk just as the sky turns pink over the lake. A few lights are still on inside where staff work late; outside, the lawn is almost empty, the day’s noise fading into quiet.

OPTION:Pause, take a photo of the lawn and lake, and let yourself appreciate that this is part of your campus life story too—not just the forms and deadlines.|The image becomes a tiny anchor on bad days, proof that your college years are more than just stress and paperwork.|+3,0,0,0.00
OPTION:Stand for a moment and mentally list three things you’re grateful for, even if they’re small.|Your nervous system calms a notch, and the path back to your dorm feels a little lighter.|+3,0,0,+0.01
OPTION:Hurry past without looking up, already drafting tomorrow’s task list in your head.|You move efficiently, but miss a small, quiet chance to refill your emotional batteries.|-1,0,0,-0.01
OPTION:Sit on the grass and spiral about everything you still haven’t done.|By the time you stand up, the sky has darkened and your anxiety has only grown louder.|-2,0,0,-0.02
